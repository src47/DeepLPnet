This directory contains models trained on ICSD/CSD data for various augmentation conditions and crystal systems. 

* all: models with all augmentations used 

* broaden: models with only gaussian broadening 

* linear_combination: models with only linear combinations of impurity phases 

* no_augmentation: no augmentation performed; i.e. perfect information data
